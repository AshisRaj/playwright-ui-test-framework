## Validating Syntax and Linting Rules

It is recommended to run Linting and syntax validation scripts locally before pushing changes to your branch in order to prevent broken code, or code that does not meet basic coding standards, making it into your remote branch.

üìù Syntax, and linting errors, must be fixed before a feature branch is allowed to be merged with the main branch, i.e. `main`.

### Syntax Validation

```sh
yarn syntax-check
or
yarn run syntax-check
```

### Run Linting Rules

```sh
yarn lint
or
yarn run lint
```
